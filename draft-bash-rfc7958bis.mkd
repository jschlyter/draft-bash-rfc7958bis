<!-- Notes for co-authors

PH: There was discussion in the algorithm rollover design team about adding comments to the XML file.
We know that developers read the file, and the comments could be helpful to them to understand things like
where they can find out more information about the future rollover.

PH: I would like to re-open the discussion of whether IANA should be publishing the PKIX and CSR files,
and when. Duane Wessels has charts that show that some resolvers are using the future trust anchor
keys before they are published in the root zone. That could happen if they pull the keys from the
key ceremony records, but it could also happen if IANA publishes the keys in the PKIX and CSR files.

PH: Appendix A needs to be filled in with the actual steps that happened for KSK 2017.

PH: Maybe get rid of the two figure numbers because they aren't used everywhere and they
are not referenced except for right above the figures.

PH: Make the wording the present active tense throughout.
For example, "is cryptographically signed" instead of "has been cryptographically signed".

The root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) has been
cryptographically signed using DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

In order to obtain secure answers from the root zone of the DNS using
DNSSEC, a client must configure a suitable trust anchor.  This
document describes the format and publication mechanisms IANA has
used to distribute the DNSSEC trust anchors.

# Introduction

The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in {{RFC1034}} and {{RFC1035}}.
DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are described in {{RFC9364}}.

In the DNSSEC protocol, Resource Record Sets (RRSets) are signed
cryptographically.  This means that a response to a query contains
signatures that allow the integrity and authenticity of the RRSet to
be verified.  DNSSEC signatures are validated by following a chain of
signatures to a "trust anchor".  The reason for trusting a trust
anchor is outside the DNSSEC protocol, but having one or more trust
anchors is required for the DNSSEC protocol to work.

The publication of trust anchors for the root zone of the DNS is an
IANA function performed by ICANN.  A detailed description of
corresponding key management practices can be found in {{DPS}}, which
can be retrieved from the IANA Repository at
&lt;https://www.iana.org/dnssec/&gt;.

This document describes the formats and distribution methods of
DNSSEC trust anchors that have been used by IANA for the root zone of
the DNS since 2010.  Other organizations might have different formats
and mechanisms for distributing DNSSEC trust anchors for the root
zone; however, most operators and software vendors have chosen to
rely on the IANA trust anchors.

The formats and distribution methods described in this document are a
complement to, not a substitute for, the automated DNSSEC trust
anchor update protocol described in {{RFC5011}}.  That protocol allows
for secure in-band succession of trust anchors when trust has already
been established.  This document describes one way to establish an
initial trust anchor that can be used by RFC 5011.

## Definitions

The term "trust anchor" is used in many different contexts in the
security community.  Many of the common definitions conflict because
they are specific to a specific system, such as just for DNSSEC or
just for S/MIME messages.

In cryptographic systems with hierarchical structure, a trust anchor
is an authoritative entity for which trust is assumed and not
derived.  The format of the entity differs in different systems, but
the basic idea, that trust is assumed and not derived, is common to
all the common uses of the term "trust anchor".

The root zone trust anchor formats published by IANA are defined in
{{ta_formats}}.  {{RFC4033}} defines a trust anchor as "A configured DNSKEY
RR or DS RR hash of a DNSKEY RR".  Note that the formats defined here
do not match the definition of "trust anchor" from {{RFC4033}};
however, a system that wants to convert the trusted material from
IANA into a Delegation Signer (DS) RR can do so.

## Changes from RFC 7958

This version of the document includes the following changes:

- There is a signficant technical change from erratum 5932 &lt;https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5932&gt;.
This is in the seventh paragraph of {{xml_semantics}}.

- The reference to the DNSSEC Practice Statement {{DPS}} was updated.

# IANA DNSSEC Root Zone Trust Anchor Formats and Semantics {#ta_formats}

IANA publishes trust anchors for the root zone in three formats:

- an XML document that contains the hashes of the DNSKEY records

- certificates in PKIX format {{RFC5280}} that contain DS records and
the full public key of DNSKEY records

- Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) in PKCS #10 format {{RFC2986}}
that contain DS records and the full public key of DNSKEY records

These formats and the semantics associated with each are described in
the rest of this section.

## Hashes in XML {#hashes}

The XML document contains a set of hashes for the DNSKEY records that
can be used to validate the root zone.  The hashes are consistent
with the defined presentation format of DS resource .

### XML Syntax {#xml_syntax}

A RELAX NG Compact Schema {{RELAX-NG}} for the documents used to
publish trust anchors is given in Figure 1.

~~~
datatypes xsd = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"

start = element TrustAnchor {
    attribute id { xsd:string },
    attribute source { xsd:string },
    element Zone { xsd:string },

    keydigest+
}

keydigest = element KeyDigest {
    attribute id { xsd:string },
    attribute validFrom { xsd:dateTime },
    attribute validUntil { xsd:dateTime }?,

    element KeyTag {
            xsd:nonNegativeInteger { maxInclusive = "65535" } },
    element Algorithm {
            xsd:nonNegativeInteger { maxInclusive = "255" } },
    element DigestType {
            xsd:nonNegativeInteger { maxInclusive = "255" } },
    element Digest { xsd:hexBinary }
}
                           Figure 1
~~~

### XML Semantics {#xml_semantics}

The TrustAnchor element is the container for all of the trust anchors
in the file.

The id attribute in the TrustAnchor element is an opaque string that
identifies the set of trust anchors.  Its value has no particular
semantics.  Note that the id element in the TrustAnchor element is
different than the id element in the KeyDigest element, described
below.

The source attribute in the TrustAnchor element gives information
about where to obtain the TrustAnchor container.  It is likely to be
a URL and is advisory only.

The Zone element in the TrustAnchor element states to which DNS zone
this container applies.  The root zone is indicated by a single
period (.) character without any quotation marks.

The TrustAnchor element contains one or more KeyDigest elements.
Each KeyDigest element represents the digest of a DNSKEY record in
the zone defined in the Zone element.

The id attribute in the KeyDigest element is an opaque string that
identifies the hash.
Note that the id element in the KeyDigest element is different than
the id element in the TrustAnchor element described above.

The validFrom and validUntil attributes in the KeyDigest element specify
the range of times that the KeyDigest element can be used as a trust anchor.
Note that the validUntil attribute of the KeyDigest element is optional.
If the relying party is using a trust anchor that has a KeyDigest element
that does not have a validUntil attribute, it can change to a trust anchor
with a KeyDigest element that does have a validUntil attribute,
as long as that trust anchor's validUntil attribute is in the future and the
DNSKEY elements of the KeyDigest are the same as the previous trust anchor.
Relying parties SHOULD NOT use a KeyDigest outside of the time range given
in the validFrom and validUntil attributes.

The KeyTag element in the KeyDigest element contains the key tag for
the DNSKEY record represented in this KeyDigest.

The Algorithm element in the KeyDigest element contains the signing
algorithm identifier for the DNSKEY record represented in this
KeyDigest.

The DigestType element in the KeyDigest element contains the digest
algorithm identifier for the DNSKEY record represented in this
KeyDigest.

The Digest element in the KeyDigest element contains the hexadecimal
representation of the hash for the DNSKEY record represented in this
KeyDigest.

### Converting from XML to DS Records

The display format for the DS record that is the equivalent of a
KeyDigest element can be constructed by marshaling the KeyTag,
Algorithm, DigestType, and Digest elements.  For example, assume that
the TrustAnchor element contains:

~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<TrustAnchor
   id="AD42165F-3B1A-4778-8F42-D34A1D41FD93"
   source="http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml">
<Zone>.</Zone>
<KeyDigest id="Kjqmt7v" validFrom="2010-07-15T00:00:00+00:00">
<KeyTag>19036</KeyTag>
<Algorithm>8</Algorithm>
<DigestType>2</DigestType>
<Digest>
49AAC11D7B6F6446702E54A1607371607A1A41855200FD2CE1CDDE32F24E8FB5
</Digest>
</KeyDigest>
</TrustAnchor>
~~~

The DS record would be:

~~~
. IN DS 19036 8 2
   49AAC11D7B6F6446702E54A1607371607A1A41855200FD2CE1CDDE32F24E8FB5
~~~

### XML Example

Figure 2 describes two fictitious trust anchors for the root zone.

~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<TrustAnchor
    id="AD42165F-B099-4778-8F42-D34A1D41FD93"
    source="http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml">
    <Zone>.</Zone>
    <KeyDigest id="42"
               validFrom="2010-07-01T00:00:00-00:00"
               validUntil="2010-08-01T00:00:00-00:00">
        <KeyTag>34291</KeyTag>
        <Algorithm>5</Algorithm>
        <DigestType>1</DigestType>
        <Digest>c8cb3d7fe518835490af8029c23efbce6b6ef3e2</Digest>
    </KeyDigest>
    <KeyDigest id="53"
               validFrom="2010-08-01T00:00:00-00:00">
        <KeyTag>12345</KeyTag>
        <Algorithm>5</Algorithm>
        <DigestType>1</DigestType>
        <Digest>a3cf809dbdbc835716ba22bdc370d2efa50f21c7</Digest>
    </KeyDigest>
</TrustAnchor>

                           Figure 2
~~~

## Certificate Signing Requests

Each public key that can be used as a trust anchor is represented as
a CSR in PKCS #10 format.  The SubjectPublicKeyInfo and Subject field
are the same as for certificates (see {{certs}} above).


# Root Zone Trust Anchor Retrieval {#retrieving}

## Retrieving Trust Anchors with HTTPS and HTTP

Trust anchors are available for retrieval using HTTPS and HTTP.

In this section, all URLs are given using the "https:" scheme.  If
HTTPS cannot be used, replace the "https:" scheme with "http:".

The URL for retrieving the set of hashes described in {{hashes}} is
&lt;https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml&gt;.


# Accepting DNSSEC Trust Anchors {#trusting_anchors}

A validator operator can choose whether or not to accept the trust
anchors described in this document using whatever policy they want.
In order to help validator operators verify the content and origin of
trust anchors they receive, IANA uses digital signatures that chain
to an ICANN-controlled Certificate Authority (CA) over the trust
anchor data.

It is important to note that the ICANN CA is not a DNSSEC trust
anchor.  Instead, it is an optional mechanism for verifying the
content and origin of the XML and certificate trust anchors.

The content and origin of the XML file can be verified using a
digital signature on the file.  IANA provides a detached
Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) {{RFC5652}} signature that chains to
the ICANN CA with the XML file.  The URL for a detached CMS signature
for the XML file is
&lt;https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.p7s&gt;.

Another method IANA uses to help validator operators verify the
content and origin of trust anchors they receive is to use the
Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol for distributing the trust
anchors.  Currently, the CA used for data.iana.org is well known,
that is, one that is a WebTrust-accredited CA.  If a system
retrieving the trust anchors trusts the CA that IANA uses for the
"data.iana.org" web server, HTTPS SHOULD be used instead of HTTP in
order to have assurance of data origin.

# Security Considerations

This document describes how DNSSEC trust anchors for the root zone of
the DNS are published.  Many DNSSEC clients will only configure IANA-
issued trust anchors for the DNS root to perform validation.  As a
consequence, reliable publication of trust anchors is important.

This document aims to specify carefully the means by which such trust
anchors are published, with the goal of making it easier for those
trust anchors to be integrated into user environments.

# Historical Note

The first KSK for use in the root zone of the DNS was
generated at a key ceremony at an ICANN Key Management Facility
(KMF) in Culpeper, Virginia, USA on 2010-06-16.  This key
entered production during a second key ceremony held at an
ICANN KMF in El Segundo, California, USA on 2010-07-12.
The resulting trust anchor was first published on 2010-07-15.

The second KSK for use in the root zone of the DNS was
